# The Joule Standard: Numerical Wind Tunnel

This repository contains the computational validation for the **Joule Standard**, a stability-based selection theory for information-regulated dissipative systems.

## Overview

The "Numerical Wind Tunnel" (Endogenous Selection Experiment) tests the hypothesis that the **von Kármán constant ($\kappa \approx 0.4$)** is a dynamically selected universal attractor. As Energy Rate Density ($\Phi_m$) accelerates, complex systems (such as civilizations) must refine their information granularity at a specific ratio ($C_{acc} \approx 2.5$) to maintain structural integrity.

### Key Results
- **Kinetic Stagnation:** Ratios significantly below 2.5 fail due to insufficient granularity to dissipate flux.
- **Thermal Melting:** Ratios significantly above 2.5 fail due to excessive internal friction and heat production.
- **The Attractor:** Survival clusters with high statistical significance near **2.5029**, validating the "1971 Necessity" and the "2030 Substrate Deadline."

## Mathematical Architecture

The simulation validates the **Beta Function ($\beta$)** of civilizational flow:

$$\beta(G) = \frac{dG}{d \ln \ell} = G \left[ 1 - \kappa \left( \frac{\Omega}{\eta(G)} \right) \right]$$

Where:
- $G$ = Information Granularity
- $\kappa$ = von Kármán Constant (~0.4)
- $\eta$ = Systemic Viscosity
