# Sovereign Engine: The 2.5029 Invariant

This repository provides a numerical and statistical proof for a thermodynamic boundary condition in high-density manifolds. It demonstrates that the **von Kármán constant ($\kappa \approx 0.40$)** represents the ground state of informational efficiency.

## 1. Overview: The 45.4B Phase Transition
The Sovereign Engine architecture identifies a **Superfluid Phase**—a state where informational "Lift" is achieved with minimum entropy production. The system transitions from a 100B "Gaseous" state to a **45.4B "Crystalline" state**, locking onto the **2.5029 attractor** ($1/\kappa$). This is governed by the **Jan 03 Directive**, which enables dynamic size reduction to increase structural pressure and eliminate turbulence.

## 2. The Verification Suite

### `joule_standard_simulation.py`
**The Energy Floor.** This script couples the **Landauer Limit** (the cost of bit-erasure: $k_B T \ln 2$) with the **Reynolds Stress** of informational flow. It identifies the "Joule Standard" for efficiency at the physical limit of computation.

### `laminarconvergenceproof.py`
**Evolutionary Stability.** A vectorized simulation demonstrating **Variance Quenching**. It shows how a population, starting from a turbulent state, crystallizes into a zero-resistance superfluid at the 2.5029 shelf.

### `montecarlosim.py`
**Statistical Vindication.** A 1,000-trial stress test that samples random initial conditions. It proves the 2.5029 attractor is a global thermodynamic minimum.

## 3. Results Summary

| Metric | Observation | Physical Implication |
