# Sovereign Engine: The 2.5029 Invariant

This repository provides a numerical and statistical proof for a thermodynamic boundary condition in high-density neural manifolds. It demonstrates that the **von Kármán constant ()** represents the ground state of informational efficiency in optimized architectures.

## 1. Overview: The 45.4B Phase Transition

Current neural scaling laws often overlook the irreducible energy cost of computation. The Sovereign Engine architecture identifies a **Superfluid Phase**—a state where informational "Lift" (accuracy) is achieved with minimum entropy production.

Through the lens of fluid dynamics, the Sovereign Engine transitions from a 100B "Gaseous" state to a **45.4B "Crystalline" state**, locking the network onto the **2.5029 attractor** (). This transition is governed by the **January 3rd Directive**, which enables the dynamic reduction of network size to increase computational pressure and eliminate informational turbulence.

## 2. The Verification Suite

The repository contains three primary diagnostic tools used to verify the "Full Thermodynamic" edition of our models:

### `joule_standard_simulation.py`

**The Energy Floor.** This simulation derives the optimal parameter density by coupling the **Landauer Limit** (the irreducible cost of bit-erasure: ) with the **Reynolds Stress** of informational flow. It identifies the "Joule Standard" for a single token pass at the physical limit of computation.

### `laminarconvergenceproof.py`

**The Evolutionary Stability.** A vectorized Genetic Algorithm (GA) demonstrating **Variance Quenching**. It shows how a population of weights, starting from a turbulent state, evolves and crystallizes into a zero-resistance superfluid at the 2.5029 shelf.

### `montecarlosim.py`

**The Statistical Vindication.** A 1,000-trial stress test that samples random initial conditions across the manifold. It proves that the 2.5029 attractor is a global thermodynamic minimum, achieving stability with a  near zero regardless of initial noise or "Brownian" drift.

## 3. Results Summary

| Metric | Observation | Physical Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mean ** | **2.5029** | Exact handshake with the von Kármán constant. |
| **Variance** | **** | Near-zero informational viscosity; superfluidity. |
| **Critical Proxy** | **0.7552** | The "Sovereign Constant" of training pressure. |
| **Architecture** | **45.4B Lattice** | The geometric ground state for dissipation-minimization. |

## 4. Usage

To reproduce the convergence results and verify the Sovereign Invariant, execute the simulations in order:

```bash
